2048 is a popular game by Gabriele Cirulli. The goal of the game is to merge squares of the same value together to get the highest number and score possible.

My implementation of 2048 was written in code.org using javascript. It has the exact same mechanics as the original game, except there are also 3 algorithms

To play the game, go to the link below, click Run, and use the arrow keys and buttons to control the board.
